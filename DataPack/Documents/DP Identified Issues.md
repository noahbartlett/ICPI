## Issues and Fixes to the Data Pack

updated: Jan 30

Here is a running list of issues that affect the Data Pack for SI and EA advisors to be aware of

1. Wrong columns referenced
    - Issue: Due some updated in the template, a few formulas point to the wrong reference columns
    - Affected Tab: SNU Targets for EA
    - Fix:
        1. Change the formulas in the 3 cells identified below, updating the column letter in bold (note that [LastColumn] will be the last row number in your Data Pack)
            * O7 =INDEX('Target Calculation'!$**BO**$5:$**BO**$[LastRow],MATCH(Tsnulist, snu,0))
            * Q7 =INDEX('Target Calculation'!$**BC**$5:$**BC**$[LastRow],MATCH(Tsnulist, snu,0))
            * U7 =INDEX('HTC Target Calculation'!**O**$5:**O**$[LastRow],MATCH(Tsnulist, snu,0))
        2. For each affected column (O, Q, U), copy the new formula down to all rows
2. KP_MAT data missing
    - Issue: The KP_MAT column in the IM distribution was missing data (only affected 5 OUs - Central Asia Region, India, Kenya, Tanzania, and Vietnam)
    - Affected Tab - Allocation by IM
    - Fix:
        1. SI advisors were identified regarding this issue, and provided either (a) the rows in column X to add KP_MAT % to if <5 rows affected, or (b) were issued new Data Packs and can be found on PEPFAR.net
3. VMMC included in EA HTC calculation
    - Issue: For the purposes of EA, VMMC and PMTCT test needs to be removed from the HTC to ensure we're not double counting those expenses in our Unit Expenditures. VMMC was mistakenly included in HTC total.
    - Affected Tab: SNU Targets for EA
    - Fix:
        1. Navigate to the HTC Target Calculation tab
        2. Unhide columns M through P
        3. Insert a new column after P
        4. In cell Q4, add the header title Total EA HTC
        5. Add a formula to columns M-P in column Q
            * Q7 = SUM(M7:P7)
        6. Copy this new formula down to all the rows in this column
        7. Navigate to the SNU Targets for EA tab
        8. Replace the formula in S7, HTC_TST(excluding PMTCT & VMMC), with the formula below
            * S7 = INDEX(**'HTC Target Calculation'!$Q$7:$Q$[LastRow]**,MATCH(Tsnulist, htc_snu,0))
        9. Copy this formula down to the rest of the rows in the column

4. TX_CURR Patient Year calculation
    - Issue: The current formula to calculate the patient year uses PMTCT_EID as a proxy for TX_CURR <1 (which is used to get TX_CURR 1-15 from the TX_CUR <15 calcuated in the Data Pack). Since PMTCT_EID over estimates those on treatment since it includes negative tests as well, so TX_NEW <1 should be used instead (as is used for the FY18 calculation).
    - Affected Tab: SNU Targets for EA
    - Fix:
        1. Change the formula in cell F7 to point to the FY17 TX_NEW <1 Target located in the DATIM Indicator Table
            * F7 =INDEX(**tx_new_u1_T**,MATCH(Tsnulist,snulist,0))
        2. Copy the formula down to all rows in column F, TX_CURR (<1) [PMTCT_EID]
        3. Rename the header to TX_CURR (<1) [**TX_NEW <1**]
5. Wrong SNU reference
  - Issue: The current formula indexes the SNU list from the main Target Calcuations tab, rather than the HTC Target Calcuation tabs. This could reference the wrong cells if the SNU lists are sorted in different orders
  - Affected Tab: SNU Targets for EA
  - Fix:
        1. Replace MATCH(Tsnulist,**snu**,0)" with MATCH(Tsnulist,**htc_snulis**,0) in columns S, T, U, and V
            * S7 = INDEX(T_htc_need,MATCH(Tsnulist, **htc_snu**,0))

6. OVC_SERV TA IM targets not adding correctly
  - Issue: The current formula is not correctly adding up the TA OVC_SERV targets on the IM targetting tab.
  - Affected Tab: PBAC IM Targets
  - Fix: 
        1. Replace =SUMIFS(D_ovc_serv_fy18,D_mech,P_mech,D_type,AP_indtype) with =SUMIFS(D_ovc_serv_fy18,D_mech,P_mech,D_type,P_indtype)            in column AG.
